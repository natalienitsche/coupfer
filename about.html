									<h3>COUPFER - The Project</h3>
									<p>
									
									
									THe COUPFER research is funded by the European Commission with a Marie Curie 
									International Incoming Fellowship. The aim of the project is to investigate h
									ow relative resources in couples are related to 
									union stability and first, second, and third births across Europe.</p>
									
									<h3>COUPFER - Abstract</h3>
									<p>In order to understand childbearing behaviour, it seems intuitively 
									important to include partnership formation and the characteristics, behaviour 
									and interactions of both partners into the scholarly analyses of fertility. 
									The empirical literature in this field, however, has so far overwhelmingly 
									studied fertility outcomes from the perspective of the woman. Only very recently 
									have studies integrated the (male) partner and couple-dynamics into models 
									of childbearing behaviour, and this couple perspective approach is now an 
									up-and coming area in social demography. A few pioneering studies have been 
									published on the topic so far, but many open questions remain. Among them are 
									the question of 1) how her and his educational attainment and employment behaviour 
									interact with each other in relating to childbearing behaviour in many European 
									nations not yet studied from a couple perspective (e.g. France, Great Britain, 
									Austria, Norway, Denmark, Eastern Europe), 2) if these relative resources may 
									play a crucial role for partnership formation and union stability, and in turn 
									only be significant for childbearing behaviour through selecting which couples 
									find and remain together 3) and how such couple dynamics may depend upon the 
									surrounding social structure and greater gender equality in the society in relating 
									to fertility outcomes and union stability. The proposed project aims at tackling all 
									of these questions. This will allow for a deeper and more detailed understanding of 
									family formation and fertility outcomes in Europe, and not only greatly advance the 
									field substantively but also make a significant contribution to the methodological 
									advancement of the field.</p>
